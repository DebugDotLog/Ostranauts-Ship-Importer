# Ostranauts Ship Importer
Import ship JSON files into existing Ostranauts save files!

Launch the game and check the "options"->"files" menu for your "save/settings" and "assets" paths.  
Ships from the ship editor are saved to "ASSETS PATH\data\ships\"

This information will be used to select the ship JSON to import and the Save File to import to.

The app will NOT modify existing save data, instead it makes a copy of the save before modifying.  
You'll find the new files in SAVENAME_imported_ship.

This application requires .NET Desktop Runtime 8.x.
